Math operations are used in:
1. Summarizing data
2. Creating new columns based on calculations
3. Finding the highest and lowest values
4. Finding total number of rows.
5. Finding averages.
The math operations include AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX, and SUM. The order BODMAS applies for the normal math operations.
## SUM ()
Sums all values in a column.
## COUNT ()
Used in finding the number of rows or records in a particular table.
## AVG ()
Finds the mean of a column containing values.
Rows containing null values are ignored by the AVG function.
## MAX () and MIN ()
For finding maximum and minimum values in a column
## DISTINCT ()
Selects all distinct values in a column.
When used with COUNT list the number of distinct entries.
This helps in looking for potential duplicates in a column.
Cannot use DISTINCT with COUNT(*)

# Filtering, Sorting and Calculating Data with SQL
Some of the benefits of filtering and sorting include:
1. Narrowing the data to what you want to retrieve.
2. Allows for specific analysis.
3. Increase query performance and speed.
4. Reduce stress on client application.
## WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is mostly used for filtering.
 It does so by using operators such as =, <>, >, <, >=, <=, BETWEEN, IS NULL.
 ## Advanced Filtering: IN, OR, AND, NOT
 The IN operator is used to retrieve specific values.
 The OR operator returns all entries from two conditions.
 The OR operator and IN operator are almost similar but IN is much faster and can be used with a long list of options.
 The AND operator combines two conditions.
 Remember to use parantheses when you want to order evaluations between OR and AND.
 Using parantheses implies AND will be evaluated first, otherwise OR will be evaluated first.
 NOT operator is used to add condition to remove a particular value.

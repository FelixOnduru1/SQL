# SQL
 My Journey Towards Learning SQL for Data Science.
I started my journey in learning SQL and hopefully I can be able to create a portfolio on this interesting journey.
 ## What is SQL?
 SQL is a Structured Query Language.
 It is a standard computer language for relational database management and manipulation.
 ## Uses of SQL
 1. Used to query, insert, update and modify data.
 2. Used for communication between you and the user.
 ## Database
 Data is a set of relataed information.
 Database is a container containing oeganized data.
 A table is a structured list of data of a specific type. It is made up of columns and rows.
 ## Relational Model
 A relational Model shows the relationship between the tables. The building blocks of a relational model are entity, relationship and attribute.

 An entity is a a person, place, thing or event.
 Relationship is used to describe association between entities.
 An attribute is simply a characteristic.
 ## Types of relationships
 1. One to one (1:1)
 2. One to many (1:M)
 3. Many to many (M:N) 
 There are several other notations out there to indicate these relationships in a relational model and in ER (entity relationship)diagrams. These include the Chen Notation, The Crow's Foot Notation, and UML Class Diagram Notation.

 ## What to remember
 Think before you code.
 Think through the design of a query before writing a single code.
 Understand the business process or subject matter the data is modeled after.
 Understand the structure and organization of the data.

 ## Why Tables?
 1. Help in creating Dashboards
 2. Help in visualizing data with other tools.
 3. Extaracting data from other sources.
 4. Build models and create predictions.


 With that I hope this gives the introduction to SQL!!!
